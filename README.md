# Rainfall-Productivity-Regression
This repository contains code to model and visualize the relationship between rainfall and crop productivity using linear regression.

# Overview

# The code does the following:
Loads rainfall and productivity data from a CSV file into NumPy arrays
Fits a simple linear regression model to the data using np.polyfit()
Generates predictions from the fitted model for given X values
Plots the original data as a scatter plot
Plots the regression line and predicted points
Calculates and prints the productivity coefficient for a sample X value
Annotates the plot with text labels for the prediction
Usage

# The main dependencies are:
Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

# To run the code:
python rainfall_regression.py

This will load inputdata7.csv, fit and plot the linear regression model, and print the sample prediction.
