# Rainfall-Productivity-Regression
This project focuses on building a simple linear regression model to predict agricultural productivity based on rainfall data. The steps involved are:

1. Import libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

2. Load the rainfall and productivity dataset into Numpy arrays.

3. Visualize the relationship between rainfall (independent variable) and productivity (dependent variable) using a scatter plot.

4. Fit a linear regression model to the data to capture the linear relationship between rainfall and productivity.

5. Use the fitted model to predict productivity for a given rainfall amount.

6. Plot the regression line on the scatter plot and highlight the predicted point.

7. Output the predicted productivity value.

8. The linear regression model establishes a statistically significant positive correlation between rainfall and productivity. This allows us to quantify the impact of rainfall on productivity.

Potential use cases:

1. Predict agricultural yields and crop planning based on weather forecasts. The predictions can help farmers optimize crop selection, irrigation needs, and harvest timelines.
   
2. Understand the impact of climate change patterns like changing rainfall on crop productivity. These insights can inform policy decisions around agriculture.

3. Estimate revenue projections for agribusiness companies relying on rainfed agriculture. The financial forecasts can aid business planning.

4. Provide actionable insights to insurance providers on crops vulnerable to weather shocks. Inform premium pricing and risk management strategies.

Overall, this simple project demonstrates how machine learning can extract valuable insights from rainfall data to drive data-based decision making in agriculture.

# Overview

# The code does the following:
Loads rainfall and productivity data from a CSV file into NumPy arrays
Fits a simple linear regression model to the data using np.polyfit()
Generates predictions from the fitted model for given X values
Plots the original data as a scatter plot
Plots the regression line and predicted points
Calculates and prints the productivity coefficient for a sample X value
Annotates the plot with text labels for the prediction
Usage

# The main dependencies are:
Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

# To run the code:
python rainfall_regression.py

This will load inputdata7.csv, fit and plot the linear regression model, and print the sample prediction.
